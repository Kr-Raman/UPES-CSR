        blogText: `<p>We all know that nutrition, along with exercise, is good for you — for toning up or slimming down or just feeling better and healthy. However, you may not know that these are especially important for your eyes, which may help preserve your vision. People are least active nowadays, partly because technology has made our lives easier. We have minimal physical activity and burn off lesser calories than we did earlier. Researches show that many adults spend a lot more than 7-8 hours a day sitting down at work, stressing their eyes, and focusing on screens. Talking about eating habits, one starts with the best intentions. You take down healthy recipes, add up kale and quinoa in your grocery list. But then something happens. You get busy with substantial work-related problems, or you spend all day running errands. Whatever the reason, life often leaves us no time or energy to prepare meals. So you order online for some easy junk snack, which leaves you feeling bloated and demotivated about ever eating healthy again.</p>
        <p>For ages, people have promoted eye exercises as a “natural” cure for vision disabilities. Here are a few different eye exercises that you must try.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Eye movements: close your eyes-move your eyes upwards- then downwards-then to the left- then to the right- repeat thrice.</li>
            <li>Focus Change: Hold a finger a few inches away from one eye - focus on your finger- move the finger away from your face slowly - look farther away for a moment - focus on your finger again and slowly move it back closer.</li>
            <li>20-20-20 Rule: focus at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes (works great for digital eye pain)</li>
            <li>Figure 8:  focus on an area about 8' away, move your eyes in the shape of figure 8 for 30 seconds, and then reverse the direction.</li>
            <li>Palming: Cup an eye in each palm for 30seconds - breathe in and out and feel the tension release- repeat thrice.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It's not just the exercise that'll help you with your eyesight if not combined with a healthy nutritional diet. When it comes to following a proper diet to fuel up your performance, it’s not as simple as replacing waffles with vegetables. So here's a list of a few best foods for your eyes.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Almonds - These contain vitamin E. Consuming regular amounts of vitamin E can help prevent age-related macular degeneration as well as cataracts. </li>
            <li>Eggs - They contain vitamin A, zinc, zeaxanthin, and lutein, which are all vital to eye health.</li>
            <li>Dairy -  Dairy contains vitamin A along with the mineral zinc. While zinc helps bring it to the eyes from the liver, Vitamin A protects the cornea.</li>
            <li>Carrots - They have vitamin A and  Beta Carotene, which can help prevent eye infections and other severe eye conditions.</li>
            <li>Oranges - Vitamin C, found mainly in fresh fruits like oranges, contributes to healthy blood vessels in your eyes. It combats cataracts development, and in combination with other nutrients and vitamins, age-related macular degeneration.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>There's a possibility that eye exercises and diet won’t benefit you. But it won't hurt to try, right? It’s also advised to get your eyes checked regularly by an eye doctor. They can often detect and treat problems before noticeable symptoms occur. Book an appointment with 9eye now and experience the best in class ophthalmic services.</p>`,

        blogText: `You see, you were born with beautiful eyes.<br />
                    Those little, magnificient yet so deep eyes looked around at everyone in one glance.<br />
                    You could see your mom, the doctors and everyone around, relentlesly rolling your eyeballs on seeing the chaos.<br />
                    You grewup and you started to explore, you were intrigued to look at new things and discover more about the beautiful nature and everything around. <br />
                    You were living your life innocently yet at its best. <br />
                    With passing years you got everything you needed, mobile, pc, tv. You became so engulfed in the new technology that you forgot about the nature that you were trying to explore, you forgot about the games you used to play with your friends outside because now it was all about playstations and video games, you forgot about interacting with people because now they were just a text away, you forgot to eat healthy beacuse the pizza was just on its way.<br />
                    Unknowingly you lost the most precious thing you were born with, you lost a part of your eyesight...<br />
                    Now you wish to see the leaves on that tree far away, you wish to see that mountain from a distance but every effort is in vain because all that you can see is blurry and not at its best. <br />
                    You regret making the wrong choices but<br />
                    its never too late, you still have a long life to get back what you lost, the moment you prioritize your vision, start eating healthy, exercise and go in for vision correction thats the time you gonna feel alot better. <br />
                    A healthy living is whats gonna make life a whole lot better for you.`,

        blogText: `<p>We understand the concern of every mother out there trying their best  to keep their baby healthy and eyehealth is one of the most important thing that shouldn’t be ignored , so we are here to help you with all your queries regarding the same.</p>
                    <p>The best thing a mother can do to protect her child’s eyes is to provide nutritious diet, but when the baby is on breastfeed and between 5-8 months of age you can surely look for other alternatives.</p>
                    <p>Being 5-8 months old your baby might have started looking at his/her own hands at this stage, so the hand-eye coordination has started to develop.</p>
                    <p>To help development:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Change the crib's position frequently and your child's position in it.</li>
                        <li>Keep reach-and-touch toys within your baby's view of about eight to 12 inches.</li>
                        <li>Talk to your baby as you walk around the room.</li>
                        <li>Alternate right and left sides with each feeding.</li>
                        <li>Help your baby explore different shapes and textures with his or her fingers.</li>
                        <li>Give your baby the freedom to crawl and explore.</li>
                        <li>Hang objects across the crib.</li>
                        <li>Play “peek-a-boo" with your baby</li>
                        <li>Your baby's eyes need to be gently cleaned with a cotton ball soaked in water every day.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>And the most important thing is to “Provide sun protection” when outdoors by means of shelter or UV coated lenses, especially if your child's eyes are light in colour and also Have your child's eyes examined regularly, particularly during infancy and childhood.</p>
